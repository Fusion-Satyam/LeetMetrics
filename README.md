* ✅ Total problems solved out of all available
* ✅ Overall acceptance rate
* ✅ LeetCode profile picture and username

### ⚠️ Notes

* This app currently uses a **public CORS proxy** (`cors-anywhere`) to bypass LeetCode's CORS restrictions. You must **activate the proxy** here before using:
  👉 [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)

* For production use, a **Node.js backend** is recommended for handling requests securely.
